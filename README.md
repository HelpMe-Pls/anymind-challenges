# AnyMind Full-Stack Developer Test 2025

Here's a little of something about how we got here: I've been through _so many_ take home tests of this kind, and finished them with this same level of care and effort, but unfortunately, they're _**all** rejected_.

So, now I'm asking you a favor: **_PLEASE_**, at your courtesy, open a PR and leave a review. It doesn't really matter if you consider my work as qualified or not, all I really need is just an honest, thoughtful review from you.

This may very well be the last time that I ever take a take home test, because I always make sure to go for the extra mile to give it my very best. I really do love this kind
